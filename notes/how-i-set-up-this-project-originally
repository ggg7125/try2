it was all through vue-cli. just do:
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add electron-builder
...then you end up pretty much with this project
but then you have to add electron-updater as well. in the main electron script: import { autoUpdater } from "electron-updater";
then add autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify(); there too, below the already existing line of win.loadURL("app://./index.html");
there are online instructions for electron-updater if something is missing
