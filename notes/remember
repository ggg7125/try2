CSS:
an html element can have multiple classes so long as you separate them by spaces:
<button class="btn btn-1">
then in CSS "btn" is your "base button" style that all buttons share, and btn-1 is a more specific style for probably just that specific button
btn {
    something: 5,
}
btn-1 {
    something: 6,
    something2: 7,
}
this is just inheritance for html

the css tutorial guy says he almost never uses ids and uses class instead for everything because class does everything id does except you can do multiple classes and inheritance.
